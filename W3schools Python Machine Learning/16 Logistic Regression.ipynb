    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic regression aims to solve classification problems. \n",
    "It does this by predicting categorical outcomes, unlike linear regression that predicts a continuous outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case there are two outcomes, which is called binomial, an example of which is predicting if a tumor is malignant or benign. Other cases have more than two outcomes to classify, in this case it is called multinomial. A common example for multinomial logistic regression would be predicting the class of an iris flower between 3 different species."
